Why is Git Branches? 

Git Branches is used if you will building new aplications that may break your code or they are not finished yet and you dont't want save
them to the main or master Branche.  But if you finished the new aplications and have certain, can merge with the main branche. 

    1- git branch (The currently branch and where the star meaning you are currently on that branch)  
    To get out use: Q
    2- git checkout -b name_of_the_branch 
    3- git checkout name_of_the_branch (switch between branche)
    4- Modifie the file 
    5- git add 
    6- git diff name_of_the_branch (To see what was modify) 
    6- Git commit 
    7- git push -u origin name_of_the_branch (for set up branch) 

    If you want you can do a pull request to merge 

    8- After a pull request you can delete if dont use anymore: 

    git checkout -d name_of_the_branch

    Git conflicts in Git: 


    Lets take a look in real life situation: There's something called merging conflicts in git where basically you're building
    your own branch and maybe other people are writting code on their branches. And master/main is getting updateded from different 
    places. So its possible for multiple people to change same files. And sometimes git doesn't understand know which code you want 
    to keep, or which code is redudant, or which code you want to get rid of.  To solve this: Manually 

    Lets try that ou: 

    1- Create a new branch
